# example gnark repo
Example of running a gnark repo.

Run:
```
go build
go run
```

May have to `go get` some dependencies first though.

I have found no evidence of a CLI tool to run gnark as a subprocess unfortunately, though the [misleading hackmd](https://hackmd.io/@gnark/gnark) does suggest that one could exist.
